## Migration guides

* [to v2.0](MIGRATION_TO_V2.md)
* [to v1.0](MIGRATION_TO_V1.md)

## Getting Setup

Before integrating with us you will need an to create your app on the developer platform and link it to a marketplace. Maestrano Cloud Integration being still in closed beta you will need to contact us beforehand to gain production access.

We provide a Sandbox environment where you can freely launch your app to test your integration. The sandbox is great to test single sign-on and API integration (e.g: Connec! API). This Sandbox is available on the developer platform on your app technical page.

To get started just go to: https://developer.maestrano.com. You will find the developer platform documentation here: [Documentation](https://maestrano.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DEV/Integrate+your+app+on+partner%27s+marketplaces).

A **.NET demo application** is also available here: https://github.com/maestrano/demoapp-dotnet

Do not hesitate to go to our Service Desk (https://maestrano.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2) if you have any question.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install Maestrano, run the following command in the Package Manager Console
```console
PM> Install-Package Maestrano
```


### Configuration

The [developer platform](https://developer.maestrano.com) is the easiest way to configure Maestrano. The only actions needed from your part is to create your application and environments on the developer platform and to create a config file. The framework will then contact the developer platform and retrieve the marketplaces configuration for your app environment.

At your application startup, just call:
```csharp
Maestrano.MnoHelper.AutoConfigure();
```
In order to call `AutoConfigure()`, you will need to provide some information.

You may either:

- provide them in your Web.config y adding a new section:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>

  ...

    <configSections>

      ...

    <section name="maestranoDevPlatform" type="Maestrano.Configuration.DevPlatform, Maestrano"/>

      ...

    </configSections>

  ...

 <maestranoDevPlatform
    host="https://developer.maestrano.com"
    apiPath="/api/config/v1"
  >
    <environment
      name="[your environment nid]"
      apiKey="[your environment key]"
      apiSecret="[your environment secret]"
    />

  </maestranoDevPlatform>
  </maestranoDevPlatform>

  ...

</configuration>
```

- You can also use environment variables as follow to configure your app environment:
```
export MNO_DEVPL_HOST=<developer platform host>
export MNO_DEVPL_API_PATH=/api/config/v1
export MNO_DEVPL_ENV_NAME=<your environment nid>
export MNO_DEVPL_ENV_KEY=<your environment key>
export MNO_DEVPL_ENV_SECRET=<your environment secret>
```

- or you may call directly autoconfigure with your needed parameters

```csharp
Maestrano.MnoHelper.AutoConfigure("https://developer.maestrano.com", "/api/config/v1", apiKey, apiSecret);
```

## Single Sign-On Setup

In order to get setup with single sign-on you will need a user model and a group model. It will also require you to write a controller for the init phase and consume phase of the single sign-on handshake.

You might wonder why we need a 'group' on top of a user. Well Maestrano works with businesses and as such expects your service to be able to manage groups of users. A group represents 1) a billing entity 2) a collaboration group. During the first single sign-on handshake both a user and a group should be created. Additional users logging in via the same group should then be added to this existing group (see controller setup below)

For more information, please consult [Multi-Marketplace Ingration](https://maestrano.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DEV/Multi-Marketplace+Integration).

### User Setup
Let's assume that your user model is called 'User'. The best way to get started with SSO is to define a class method on this model called 'findOrCreateForMaestrano' accepting a Maestrano.Sso.User and aiming at either finding an existing maestrano user in your database or creating a new one. Your user model should also have a 'Provider' property and a 'Uid' property used to identify the source of the user - Maestrano, LinkedIn, AngelList etc..

### Group Setup
The group setup is similar to the user one. The mapping is a little easier though. Your model should also have the 'Provider' property and a 'Uid' properties. Also your group model could have a AddMember method and also a hasMember method (see controller below)

### Controller Setup
You will need two controller action init and consume. The init action will initiate the single sign-on request and redirect the user to Maestrano. The consume action will receive the single sign-on response, process it and match/create the user and the group.

The init action is all handled via Maestrano methods and should look like this:
```csharp
using Maestrano;

...

public class MaestranoController : Controller
{
    //You should have a different url per marketplace
    //For example /maestrano/init/?marketplace=%{marketplace}
    /// <summary> /maestrano/init/{marketplace}</summary>
    public ActionResult Init(string marketplace)
    {

      var request = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request;

      var ssoUrl = MnoHelper.With(marketplace).Sso.BuildRequest(request.QueryString).RedirectUrl();
      return Redirect(ssoUrl);
  }
}
```

Based on your application requirements the consume action might look like this:
```csharp
using Maestrano;

...

public class MaestranoController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Consume(string marketplace)
    {

        var request = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request;
        //Retrieving the Maestrano configuration preset from the marketplace id
        var preset = MnoHelper.With(marketplace);
        // Get SAML response, build maestrano user and group objects
        var samlResp = preset.Sso.BuildResponse(request.Params["SAMLResponse"]);

        // Check response validity
        if (samlResp.IsValid()) {
          var mnoUser = new Maestrano.Sso.User(samlResp);
          var mnoGroup = new Maestrano.Sso.Group(samlResp);

          // Build/Map local entities
          var localGroup = MyGroup.FindOrCreateForMaestrano(mnoGroup);
          var localUser = MyUser.FindOrCreateForMaestrano(mnoUser);

          // Add localUser to the localGroup if not already part
          // of it
          if (!localGroup.HasMember(localUser)){
            localGroup.AddMember(localUser);
          }
          var session = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Session;
          session["marketplace"] = marketplace;
          // Set Maestrano session - used for Single Logout
          preset.Sso.SetSession(session, mnoUser);

          return Redirect("/");
        } else {
          return Content("Invalid SAML Response");
        }
    }
}
```
Note that for the consume action you should disable CSRF authenticity if your framework is using it by default. If CSRF authenticity is enabled then your app will complain on the fact that it is receiving a form without CSRF token.

### Other Controllers
If you want your users to benefit from single logout then you should define the following filter in a module and include it in all your controllers except the one handling single sign-on authentication.

```csharp
var preset = MnoHelper.With(marketplace);
var mnoSession = new Maestrano.Sso.Session(preset, httpContext.Session);

if (!mnoSession.IsValid()) {
  Response.Redirect(MnoHelper.With(marketplace).Sso.InitUrl());
}
```

The above piece of code makes at most one request every 3 minutes (standard session duration) to the Maestrano website to check whether the user is still logged in Maestrano. Therefore it should not impact your application from a performance point of view.

If you start seing session check requests on every page load it means something is going wrong at the http session level. In this case feel free to send us an email and we'll have a look with you.

### Redirecting on logout
When Maestrano users sign out of your application you can redirect them to the Maestrano logout page. You can get the url of this page by calling:

```csharp
  //Retrieve current user uid
  var userUid = getUserUid();
  MnoHelper.With(marketplace).Sso.LogoutUrl(userUid);
```
or if you have the `Session`

```csharp
var session = new Session(marketplace, request.getSession());
session.LogoutUrl();
```


### Redirecting on error
If any error happens during the SSO handshake, you can redirect users to the following URL:

```csharp
MnoHelper.With(marketplace).Sso.UnauthorizedUrl()
```

## Account Webhooks
Single sign on has been setup into your app and Maestrano users are now able to use your service. Great! Wait what happens when a business (group) decides to stop using your service? Also what happens when a user gets removed from a business? Well the controllers describes in this section are for Maestrano to be able to notify you of such events.

### Groups Controller (service cancellation)
Sad as it is a business might decide to stop using your service at some point. On Maestrano billing entities are represented by groups (used for collaboration & billing). So when a business decides to stop using your service we will issue a DELETE request to the webhook.account.groups_path endpoint (typically /maestrano/account/groups/:id).

Maestrano only uses this controller for service cancellation so there is no need to implement any other type of action - ie: GET, PUT/PATCH or POST. The use of other http verbs might come in the future to improve the communication between Maestrano and your service but as of now it is not required.

The controller example below reimplements the authenticate_maestrano! method seen in the [metadata section](#metadata) for completeness. Utimately you should move this method to a helper if you can.

The example below needs to be adapted depending on your application:
```csharp
public HttpResponseMessage DisableGroup(string groupId)
{
    // Authentication
    var request = HttpContext.Current.Request
    var authenticated = MnoHelper.With(marketplace).Authenticate(request);

    if (authenticated) {
      var mnoGroup = MyGroupModel.findByMnoId(groupId);
      mnoGroup.disableAccess();
    }

    ...
}
```

### Group Users Controller (business member removal)
A business might decide at some point to revoke access to your services for one of its member. In such case we will issue a DELETE request to the webhook.account.group_users_path endpoint (typically /maestrano/account/groups/:group_id/users/:id).

Maestrano only uses this controller for user membership cancellation so there is no need to implement any other type of action - ie: GET, PUT/PATCH or POST. The use of other http verbs might come in the future to improve the communication between Maestrano and your service but as of now it is not required.

The controller example below reimplements the authenticate_maestrano! method seen in the [metadata section](#metadata) for completeness. Utimately you should move this method to a helper if you can.

The example below needs to be adapted depending on your application:

```csharp
public HttpResponseMessage DisableGroup(string groupId, string userId)
{
    // Authentication
    var request = HttpContext.Current.Request;
    var authenticated = MnoHelper.With(marketplace).Authenticate(request);

    if (authenticated) {
      var mnoGroup = MyGroupModel.findByMnoId(mnoId);
      mnoGroup.removeUserById(userId);
    }

    ...
}
```

## API
The maestrano package also provides bindings to its REST API allowing you to access, create, update or delete various entities under your account (e.g: billing).

### Payment API

## Connec!â„¢ Data Sharing
Maestrano offers the capability to share actual business data between applications via its data sharing platform Connec!â„¢.

The platform exposes a set of RESTful JSON APIs allowing your application to receive data generated by other applications and update data in other applications as well!

Connec!â„¢ also offers the ability to create webhooks on your side to get automatically notified of changes happening in other systems.

Connec!â„¢ enables seamless data sharing between the Maestrano applications as well as popular apps such as QuickBooks and Xero. One connector - tens of integrations!

### Making Requests

Connec!â„¢ REST API documentation can be found here: http://maestrano.github.io/connec

The Maestrano API provides a built-in client - based on Restsharp - for connecting to Connec!â„¢. Things like connection and authentication are automatically managed by the Connec!â„¢ client.


```csharp
// Pass the customer group id as argument
var preset = Maestrano.with(marketplace);
var client = Maestrano.Connec.Client.New(preset, "cld-f7f5g4");
// Using a specific Configuration Preset
// Or
var client = preset.ConnecClient("cld-f7f5g4");


// Retrieve all organizations (customers and suppliers) created in other applications
var resp = client.Get("/organizations);
resp.Content; // returns the raw response "{\"organizations\":[ ... ]}"

// Retrieve a parsed response (assuming models OrganizationsResult and Organization exists in your application) for example
class OrganizationsResult{
  [JsonProperty("organizations")]
  public List<Organization> Organizations { get; set; }
}

public class Organization
{
        [JsonProperty("id")]
        public string Id { get; set; }
        //etc...
} 

RestResponse<Organization> resp = client.Get<OrganizationsResult>('/organizations');
resp.Data // returns a native object

// Create a new organization
var body = new Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, string>>();
var entity = new Dictionary<string, string>();
entity.Add("name", "Jazz Corp Inc.");
body.Add("organizations", entity);
client.Post('/organizations', JsonConvert.SerializeObject(body))

// Update an organization
var updBody = new Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, bool>>();
var update = new Dictionary<string, bool>();
entity.Add("is_customer", true);
updBody.Add("organizations", entity);
client.Put('/organizations/e32303c1-5102-0132-661e-600308937d74', JsonConvert.SerializeObject(updBody));

### Webhook Notifications
If you have configured the Maestrano API to receive update notifications (see 'connecSubscriptions' configuration at the top) from Connec!â„¢ then you can expect to receive regular POST requests on the notification_path you have configured.

Notifications are JSON messages containing the list of entities that have recently changed in other systems. You will only receive notifications for entities you have subscribed to.

Example of notification message:
```ruby
{
  "organizations": [
    { "id": "e32303c1-5102-0132-661e-600308937d74", name: "DoeCorp Inc.", ... }
  ],
  "people": [
    { "id": "a34303d1-4142-0152-362e-610408337d74", first_name: "John", last_name: "Doe", ... }
  ]
}
```

Entities sent via notifications follow the same data structure as the one described in our REST API documentation (available at http://maestrano.github.io/connec)
